    choices: ['Cities have more people producing body heat', 'Concrete and asphalt absorb more solar energy and release heat; fewer plants reduce evaporative cooling', 'Urban pollution blocks cooling breezes', 'Tall buildings trap cold air at street level'],
    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Impervious surfaces (concrete, asphalt) have low albedo and high heat capacity — they absorb solar radiation efficiently and release it slowly as heat. Reduced vegetation means less evapotranspiration cooling. This is thermal energy transfer at an urban scale (6.PS3.2).',

    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Plant root systems anchor soil, slow water movement, and increase infiltration. After wildfire removes vegetation, rain runs off rapidly, carrying topsoil and ash into waterways — disrupting the water cycle at the watershed scale (6.ESS2.4).',

    answerIndex: 2,
    explanation: 'No single renewable source is always available (clouds block solar; calm periods reduce wind). A hybrid system with complementary sources and battery storage ensures consistent power regardless of weather or season — applying engineering design principles (6.ESS3.2, 6.ETS1.2).',

    choices: ['American chestnuts were genetically uniform, with no natural resistance variants to select for survival', 'Fungi are always more powerful than trees', 'The trees had too much genetic diversity', 'Environmental pollution weakened all forests equally'],
    answerIndex: 0,
    explanation: 'Low genetic diversity means a population has few or no individuals with resistance traits. When a novel pathogen arrives, natural selection cannot save the population — there are no resistant variants to survive and reproduce. This is why genetic diversity is critical to species survival (6.LS4.1).',

    answerIndex: 1,
    explanation: 'Low-pressure systems form where air rises. As air rises, it cools and moisture condenses — producing clouds and precipitation. Winds converge into the low-pressure center, creating stormy conditions (6.ESS2.7).',
